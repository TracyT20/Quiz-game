# Quiz-game
Tkinter quiz game in Python, using Object oriented programming (OOP) and a Rest API to extract quiz questions and answers. 

There are 10 true/false type quiz questions but this number can be edited. 

click the  red "X" if false and green "âœ”" if true. 
The app changes to "green" if the right answer is selected, and your score increases by one, and "red" if the wrong answer is selected. 

The right answer is displayed in the console after every guess.
